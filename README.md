# Housing & Land Price Econometric Model  

This project analyzes U.S. housing price dynamics using autoregressive models, stationarity tests, and forecasting techniques. It includes:

## Methods  
- AR(1) and AR(2) models  
- Log-differencing  
- ACF & PACF diagnostics  
- Dickey–Fuller stationarity testing  
- Holt-Winters additive smoothing  
- Double exponential smoothing  
- Naïve and drift forecasts  

## Data Sources  
The model uses monthly U.S. home price index data covering 1982–2024.

## Key Findings  
- Level regressions produced a misleading R² (~0.95) due to non-stationary shared trends.  
- After differencing and log transformations, the model produced a more reliable R² (~0.13).  
- Real GDP and real interest rate are significant predictors of housing price movement.  

## Files  
- `Land Prices as a Benchmark for the U.S. Economy.pptx`  
- Forecasting models (to be added)  
- Code snippets (Python & Stata)  

## Summary  
Housing prices act as a benchmark for the U.S. economy and can be used to predict macro fluctuations. This repo documents the modeling, results, and visualizations.
